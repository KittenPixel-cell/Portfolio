<h1 align="center">KITTENPIXEL'S Portfolio</h1>

This is my portfolio.

<h2>About</h2>

I have been developing for about 3 years now in Lua, c#, javascript, and much more. I am mainly focused on Roblox development as I have the most experience in Roblox studio.

<h2>How I started</h2>

I started since I looked up to my dad who is a programmer and software engineer which inspired me to start programming.

<h2>Past Work</h2>

<h2>Fully working application center I made.</h2>
This is for my SCPF. 

The reading application in the game does not work yet.

<h2>Simple core game.</h2>

This is the first game I made that works and is having a remake done. Please don't mind the icon of the game I know it's bad. The icon text is also off.
