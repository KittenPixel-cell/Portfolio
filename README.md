# KittenPixel's Personal Portfolio

As this is my Personal Portfolio I will first explain how I got into programming when I was about 11 I got into programming and made my first Roblox game, and my friends loved it now that I'm 14 I can make even more advanced stuff, and my most advanced game so far was a core game I went through self-teaching stuff and it took 2 months to finish the core game. I made the core game when I was younger and a remake is being worked I will add its src to the private repository I give to my interviewers once it's done.

It's the core startup. Here is the old one so yall can see what it was https://www.roblox.com/games/8228365129/Astral-Science-Energy-Research-Space-Station I have also taken advantage over the years to learn more and I am willing to go through whatever training it takes to join new game projects, or show of my work in real-time if I forgot something what do I do go straight the dev forms I like to see if someone posted on it first if they didn't do it myself because it makes me learn more by doing it my self.
